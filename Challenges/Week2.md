#Command line basics.

On a Mac this is easy, go to the search icon, type in terminal and hit enter.

On a Linux OS, it is also easy: [Ubuntu] (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal) and [Debian](https://wiki.debian.org/Console). Other flavors of Linux have their own flare, and community documentation is available - just google it!  

For Windows users, this is a bit more difficult.  Windows comes with a program called [PowerShell](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/dd742419.aspx). For the purposes of coding commons, we will not use PowerShell. Instead, we suggest you use a terminal emulator that has similar functionality to terminal/command line. Since we will be using Git later in the semester, we suggest you install [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/index.html). The Git BASH emulation has the same functions as what Mac and Linux users  

##Challenges
For those just getting started with the command line/terminal/bash the goal of today is to understand the connect between the command line and the user interface (what you have been using up until now).

  * Make a new folder named codingcommons and a file named terminalcheatsheet.txt inside the folder  
  * Open the text file in the command line, add the following commands and define them:
    * cd
    * ls
    * pwd
    * mkdir
    * touch
    * cat

If you have never touched the command line, I highly suggest using Codecademy's intro to the command line. It takes about an hour to an hour and a half, but you can run through relevant commands to then use your computer's terminal.
